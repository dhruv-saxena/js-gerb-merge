js-gerb-merge
=============

Merge gerbers and panelize PCBs in your browser. This project is on-going and not yet in a usable state. If you want to use this, clone the repo and open js-gerb-merge.html in Firefox/Chrome

Libraries used
--------------

- jQuery 1.10.2
- JSZip 2.0.0
- Raphael 2.1.2
- jQuery Mousewheel

EDIT
----

Got Pwned. It looks like what I want is directly supported KiCAD (File -> Append Board). So there is no need for this tool at all and I won't be developing this any further.
